# UnrealEar
Realistic sound bouncing Plugin for Unreal Engine 4

With the help of LineTraces, the BouncingSoundCue simulates the path the sound would bounce off the walls. 
If a LineTrace hits the BouncingSoundReceiver, the set sound is played at the hit location. The tone is changed accordingly to its taken path. 

You can have multiple BouncingSoundCue but only one BouncingSoundReceiver per Level.
